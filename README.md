# Generate Handwritten Digit Images using DCGAN 🧠✨

This project uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic handwritten digit images similar to the MNIST dataset.

## 📝 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates the power of DCGANs in generating synthetic images that resemble handwritten digits. The model consists of:
- A **Generator** that learns to create realistic images.
- A **Discriminator** that learns to distinguish between real and fake images.

Both networks are trained in an adversarial fashion, improving each other over time.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- TensorFlow / Keras 🧠
- NumPy 📊
- Matplotlib 📈
- MNIST Dataset 🖋️

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Install the required packages (e.g., `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`).
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Generate_handwritten_digit_images_DCGAN.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in order to train the DCGAN and generate digit images.

## 📸 Sample Output

After training, the generator will produce handwritten digits like:
```
